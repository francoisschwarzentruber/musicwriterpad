# install electron

https://zestedesavoir.com/tutoriels/996/vos-applications-avec-electron/
Electron uses main.js in the main. The rest of the application is in Typescript.

At some point, I want to use robotjs. You need to install that:
sudo dnf install libXtst-devel

But npm install robotjs failed. :(.

# Compile

The command tsc compiles all *.ts (for instance main.ts).




# Vexflow

At the beginning, I wanted to use Vexflow to display musical elements but I had difficulties to give custom positions to the different object. However, Vexflow is very nice. You may find some help here:

# Roadmap
- add robotjs to directly write in the software you want
- add the support of rests :)
- make a packaging
